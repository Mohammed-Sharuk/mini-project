Memory Game Task
Memory Game where players flip cards to find matching pairs.
 
Create a basic HTML layout with a container for the game board.
Include a header with the game title and a restart button.
Implement the game logic to handle card flipping. When a card is clicked, it should flip to reveal the front face.
Implement a shuffle function to randomize the card positions at the start of the game.
Track the state of the game (e.g., which cards have been flipped, which pairs have been found).
Implement the logic to check for matching pairs. If two cards match, they should remain face-up. If they do not match, they should flip back after a short delay.
Add a restart function that resets the game board and shuffles the cards.
Clean, well-documented code for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
A brief README file explaining the project, how to set it up, and how to play the game.
